# Buried

A twin-stick zombie shooter inspired by Stardew Valley's Journey of the Prairie King. Made in 3 weeks as my first Godot project. Abandoned due to lack of motivation.

## About

Fight off waves of zombies in a wild west setting. Move with WASD, shoot with arrow keys, and survive increasingly challenging zombie hordes. It's not infinite; there's an end if you make it that far.

## Features

- **8-directional movement and shooting** - Classic twin-stick controls
- **Power-ups:**
  - Coffee - Increased movement speed
  - Machine Gun - Rapid fire mode
  - Nuke - Clears entire map of zombies
  - Shotgun - 3-bullet spread shot
- **Progressive difficulty** - Zombies get faster as waves continue
- **Finite waves** - There's an actual ending (it's beatable)

## Controls

- **WASD** - Move
- **Arrow Keys** - Shoot in 8 directions

## Development

This was my first time using both Godot and Aseprite. Started strong, got a playable prototype working, then hit the wall due to skill issue.

Just wanted to recreate that Prairie King feel. Got close enough, called it done.

## Tech

- **Engine:** Godot 4.5.1
- **Art:** Aseprite v1.3.15

It works, it's playable, it's just not *finished*. And that's okay.
